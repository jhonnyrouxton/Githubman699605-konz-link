# Githubman699605-konz-link
Just another show of GitHub man 6996 thingy 
 HOW TO USE: First, copy the link, and instead of putting it in inspect element, go to a new tab, and paste it in. Secondly, look over them, and choose one you like, (I'd recommend all blooks, ow a gui, the all blooks is not permanent. ) After you've chosen, click, or tap the item and drag it into the bookmarks bar. Go to blooket, and click the bookmark. The hacks should work. Any problems, make sure the send them to Githubman6996 or smth.
